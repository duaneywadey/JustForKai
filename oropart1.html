						<h2>Oro (Part 1)</h2>
						<div class="poem">
							<div class="poemtext">
							Could feel the excitement running through my veins
							A huge excitement on my face, and the joy I couldn’t contain
							Have I forgotten something? 
							I had to look all over my place
							Ensuring everything was placed in my suitcase

							Racing heartbeat as I moved out of the house
							Kissed my mom goodbye and put on my mask
							Carefully put on my jacket as I walked towards the terminal
							Excitement was replaced with nervousness. 
							Unsure if this trip will be a successful one

							Went inside the bus and listened to some music 
							Tapped on my gallery and observed her priceless beauty 
							“Will she ever like me?” A question that conquered my mind 
							Asked myself, “what if I showed up to her and she realized, 
							Her decisions weren’t right?” 

							Calmed myself as much as I could
							Finally at the airport! Flying time to Oro is an hour and a half
							Sat on my seat and unknowingly slept 
							Just woke up all of a sudden 
							The passengers were fixing their hair unkempt
							Realized that they were preparing for take-off
							Such a shame that my mind couldn’t concentrate 

							Just landed on the airport of Oro
							Taxis were everywhere, announcing their rates and promo
							Picked one and brought me to a place called Oro
							Messaged her again and asked about the meeting place 
							It was a coffee shop where she sipped coffee
							And studied for exams which she would ace 

							Asked the taxi to drop me to the nearest gift shop
							Bought chocolate bars, a bouquet of sunflowers.
							And even wrote a poem in hopes of getting her in love
							Hehe! Perhaps this was just my way of expression! 
							What if I actually had a chance, and she said yes to my question?
