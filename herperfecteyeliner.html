						<h2>Her Perfect Eyeliner </h2>
						<div class="poem">
							<div class="poemtext">
							A poem dedicated to the girl with the perfect eyeliner
							So many boys have their hearts only for her
							With face as pretty as shades of diamond
							Perfection on her face never fades, even till dawn

							She’s a woman of unending aspirations 
							Persevering with full effort for her goals and motivations
							Special to my heart, that’s what I’m always sure of
							Rarer than the rarest rubies, her style and character

							Will she ever read this letter?
							Could other boys be stronger than me in this battle?
							I hope for the best, she considers me as her lover
							Never have I had this love 
							A love as powerful as the brightest stars in the universe
